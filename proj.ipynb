It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

Yeah, so with the motion, basically the motion tried to estimate what's the motion between two frames, right? If it may image is there, but after it's there, and it looks at how many points are well matched. Okay. So you can see that, like somebody speaking and so on, so before the shot, you can see that usually there are like 90% of the points, at least, right? There's some motion, so... But then, after suddenly, if you go from one frame and you try too much, all the points here, we've like a translation, plus a zoom, plus maybe some rotation, you can't find anything well. So basically, you see that the number of points, maybe only 10% of the points you can match well. So it's easy to detect. And after you can see that indeed, because it's a long shot, and it's almost like a flat plane, you can do a very good registration so the number of points is very high. I mean, the number of points that are matching. And here you basically hear with the histogram. You can see it's very flat, but of course, you should go from this histogram to this, which is essentially green. You have this thickness, a measure, which is here, the kite too.

I mean, because the ocean, I mean, it was in the shot we've seen, because especially with Kite to square it, the amplitude it's much bigger than with Bata-Sharia. Right? You can see that it could go to 700. And when it's very nothing, it can be zero. What's Bata-Sharia is between zero and one. So you have not so much amplitude. But still, in some of these videos, for instance, even if we're going to go now, if we want to go now, for the kayak kids, I don't know. At some point, he's targeting two kayaks and he's moving quite fast to what's to other people. I don't know what happened there. If it was detected as a shot, I don't know. Yeah.\"\n",

Maybe after they have this and they may say, okay, just by looking at least the summary, so maybe for the summary we could do better keyframe extraction for instance.

              "\"SPEAKER_02: Okay So as you guys know ISSCO is too small Well the building is too small for our group So we're moving to a new building Uh it's gonna be the building across the street And we're actually moving in three weeks But the problem is that the administration wants to know who is going to be in what office in the new building and where we're we're gonna put things like the printer the fax machine all the big equipment And the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people and equipment And they want to know where we're gonna do all this by November second So that means basically next Tuesday And since we don't really have any other time we have to make these decisions today What we're getting is nine rooms for a maximum of eighteen people which is okay 'cause there's only fifteen of us And all the rooms have windows luckily so there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't Um there's two views either of the old town or the mountains and the rooms have various sizes There's two three people rooms five two person rooms which are on the corners of the building so you actually get windows on two walls and two one person rooms That's pretty much what the building looks like Um and then you have the number of people per room The courtyard because we're on the sixth floor you can't actually go out to it but it just means that the windows look out onto open space Um you can see the bathrooms the elevators are sort of further down the hall The purple bar at the bottom sort of on the right is the mail-boxes All of the windows open you can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building And the equipment that we have to put somewhere are like I said the photocopier which is really big the fax machine which is not so big and the printer which is relatively big Each office has a white board a bulletin board and a coat rack No cupboards like we have in the current offices and each person gets their own chair their own corner desk so like the the ones that we have now um a small filing cabinet with three drawers and by small I mean they're about that.\\nSPEAKER_03:Mm-hmm.\\nSPEAKER_02:tall and one sort of hanging shelf So we don't get the bookcases like we have now but just one shelf that's attached to the wall And the people that we have to place uh you can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on And I guess the question the first question is how we want to organise people Whether we want to do it by rank or by project or I don't know put all the P_H_D_ students together all the professors together that sort of thing So the idea is that we come up with a plan there's another group who's gonna be working on the same plan later this week And then Andre and I have to do presentations for the university administrators on the second So we have to come up with a plan possibly if we have time a presentation a quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best Okay.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm-hmm.\\nSPEAKER_03:Alright.\\nSPEAKER_02:So anyone have any ideas or I guess.\\nSPEAKER_00:Uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hall in terms of security stuff if we can I mean my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hall.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:Um Okay.\\nSPEAKER_02:Um I think it's the security is sort of the same as it is in the current building.\\nSPEAKER_02:So as long as the things are physically attached to the wall so.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:they can't be removed.\\nSPEAKER_03:We can put it.\\nSPEAKER_02:then it.\\nSPEAKER_00:Okay Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:should be okay to leave them in the hall It's just a question of whether you are.\\nSPEAKER_02:printing sensitive documents or.\\nSPEAKER_03:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:whatever.\\nSPEAKER_04:So we only get one printer for fifteen people.\\nSPEAKER_02:Um well we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers I think Susan has a personal.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:printer Gisella has one maybe.\\nSPEAKER_02:I can't.\\nSPEAKER_00:and.\\nSPEAKER_02:remember.\\nSPEAKER_00:it Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:who else Yeah But no-one else gets.\\nSPEAKER_02:their own printer In terms of equipment it's sort of the same thing as we have.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm-hmm Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:now Um So what I'd propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into.\\nSPEAKER_02:specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Mm yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to.\\nSPEAKER_03:Okay.\\nSPEAKER_02:exactly where to put people Does that work Oh and on the map the little half-circular well quater circles are.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm-hmm.\\nSPEAKER_02:doors which I'm.\\nSPEAKER_03:'Kay.\\nSPEAKER_00:okay.\\nSPEAKER_02:assuming you've figured out but just.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:in case And there's just the one room that actually has two doors going into it.\\nSPEAKER_04:The three person.\\nSPEAKER_02:the.\\nSPEAKER_04:room.\\nSPEAKER_02:person room on the right Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:rooms.\\nSPEAKER_00:yeah And do we need a room like a reading room or Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yes yeah A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room.\\nSPEAKER_03:That's a good idea.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm Okay.\\nSPEAKER_02:So we should leave a space for that And we.\\nSPEAKER_02:can because like I said maximum eighteen people in those rooms and there is only fifteen of.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Mm Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:us And I don't know if you've noticed but two of us are only here half the time So.\\nSPEAKER_02:Martin and David um are half the time at the E_P_F_L_ and half the time in Geneva So sort of keep that in.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:mind I guess when you are doing the actual planning.\\nSPEAKER_04:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_00:The first split we can do is between administration and reasearch uh I.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:mean it's completely different work so we can deal with administration and decide something for administration and then for the other.\\nSPEAKER_02:Mm-hmm Yeah But Gisella's really the only.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah But at least deal with.\\nSPEAKER_03:administrator.\\nSPEAKER_02:administrator Yeah Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:that particular situation.\\nSPEAKER_00:and then see with the other because I was thinking uh Gisella is quite I mean Gisella's work is quite noisy because it's secretary so yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah And she's always moving.\\nSPEAKER_00:lot of phone call and stuff like that.\\nSPEAKER_00:so Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:around No.\\nSPEAKER_00:so you won't share an office with Gisella.\\nSPEAKER_00:unless you are fifty per cent and not the fifty per cent Gisella is.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:working which is another condition.\\nSPEAKER_02:Which I don't know if we can assume that there isn't going to be any overlap.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:between.\\nSPEAKER_00:So I don't know maybe we can decide that Gisella is having one of the one person room.\\nSPEAKER_04:Yeah I I would suggest that.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah that would.\\nSPEAKER_04:too Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:maybe convenient.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah Either.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:that or maybe put her in a two person room.\\nSPEAKER_03:With someone Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:with the equipment or.\\nSPEAKER_03:and with.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:the the.\\nSPEAKER_03:someone.\\nSPEAKER_03:who is who is fifty.\\nSPEAKER_02:photocopier or Maybe not.\\nSPEAKER_03:percent.\\nSPEAKER_02:the photocopier but the printer.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah But at least the thing we know that Gisella is gonna be alone.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah okay.\\nSPEAKER_00:Or.\\nSPEAKER_03:mm-hmm.\\nSPEAKER_00:equipment but humanly.\\nSPEAKER_02:And not with a hundred.\\nSPEAKER_02:percent staff.\\nSPEAKER_00:alone.\\nSPEAKER_02:yeah a staff worker.\\nSPEAKER_04:Okay so that's a one person room but we don't know how how big they are Or it's hard to tell I mean Gisella has this funny uh typing uh.\\nSPEAKER_03:Typing.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah I mean the.\\nSPEAKER_04:thing Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:machine.\\nSPEAKER_02:aren't tiny if you look at the.\\nSPEAKER_04:Computer fax.\\nSPEAKER_02:this.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_04:So probably she should get the fax right.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah yeah that.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yes.\\nSPEAKER_02:makes sense to put the fax in there Uh So.\\nSPEAKER_00:And then I think the main discussion we should have is um if we want to make group of among the same project or among the same title.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:Or uh yeah professor assistent or uh.\\nSPEAKER_00:or.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Or Yeah Couple of professor and assistant or.\\nSPEAKER_03:Or uh yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:That's more a conceptual than a practical question.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:Well the third option is just completely mix everyone up.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:which some.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:people say is better sort of for a group environment so that you are not stuck only with the people who are working on your.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah that's.\\nSPEAKER_02:project Right.\\nSPEAKER_03:true.\\nSPEAKER_02:share an office with someone.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:who's on a completely different project you find out.\\nSPEAKER_02:about that.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:project but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular.\\nSPEAKER_03:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_00:yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:basis.\\nSPEAKER_03:mm But still I find it's quite easy if you are with people who work in the same project in the same room because you have the meetings or people come and ask you discuss things maybe I don't know if it's uh for other people who is not working on the same.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Yeah but.\\nSPEAKER_03:project Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:will have this reading.\\nSPEAKER_03:true.\\nSPEAKER_00:room which can be.\\nSPEAKER_03:true.\\nSPEAKER_04:'Kay uh will.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_04:it be dedicated for reading and for studying or can we have meetings there Can reserve it for meetings.\\nSPEAKER_02:I think it's not a question of reserving it because there's other rooms at the university that you can reserve for a.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah for a.\\nSPEAKER_02:meeting.\\nSPEAKER_00:real meeting.\\nSPEAKER_02:if it's.\\nSPEAKER_02:empty then sure you can use it.\\nSPEAKER_03:You can.\\nSPEAKER_02:for a.\\nSPEAKER_02:meeting There's nothing wrong with.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:that But.\\nSPEAKER_03:mm-hmm.\\nSPEAKER_02:think if someone's already reading in there it's not.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:fair to go and kick them out just because you want to have a.\\nSPEAKER_02:meeting 'cause.\\nSPEAKER_04:Well the the problem is if you have to go across the building and it adds some overhead every time you want to have some short.\\nSPEAKER_03:Meeting about.\\nSPEAKER_04:meeting.\\nSPEAKER_03:the.\\nSPEAKER_00:No.\\nSPEAKER_04:discuss.\\nSPEAKER_03:project.\\nSPEAKER_04:some issues Or maybe we shouldn't call.\\nSPEAKER_02:But if you're having a.\\nSPEAKER_04:it.\\nSPEAKER_02:short meeting you don't.\\nSPEAKER_04:but.\\nSPEAKER_02:really make an appointment for it You just kind.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:of go to someone's office and go down.\\nSPEAKER_03:Mm-hmm.\\nSPEAKER_02:for a coffee or.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:whatever 'Cause there's still the cafeterias that you can use for informal.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm yeah The other thing we should take into account is if you receive student or not because.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:Marianne and I interact a lot with.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah Hmm.\\nSPEAKER_00:student and we.\\nSPEAKER_00:have reception hours and stuff like that.\\nSPEAKER_02:Mm-hmm Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:So it means you get time where a lot of people come along and talk and So.\\nSPEAKER_00:it's maybe.\\nSPEAKER_02:And the other.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah so maybe.\\nSPEAKER_02:too.\\nSPEAKER_00:it's not really.\\nSPEAKER_02:there's.\\nSPEAKER_00:nice.\\nSPEAKER_02:you Well but.\\nSPEAKER_00:to have to share an office with somebody like us having a lot of social life.\\nSPEAKER_00:and.\\nSPEAKER_02:then you either share.\\nSPEAKER_03:People.\\nSPEAKER_02:offices with each.\\nSPEAKER_03:going.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:other which doesn't really solve the problem because chances are you are not gonna have office hours at the exact same time.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah we don't.\\nSPEAKER_02:So you're.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:still going to have Like unless you get individual.\\nSPEAKER_02:offices I don't know if there's an easy way.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah I dunno.\\nSPEAKER_02:to.\\nSPEAKER_02:find a solution for that 'Cause even if each of you share with a professor then it's the same thing for.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:the professor.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yep yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:But it is something to keep in mind Unless you end up sharing an office with someone where your schedules completely don't overlap and then you can schedule office.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:hours when the other person isn't there Some.\\nSPEAKER_02:people come in around eleven and some people come in around eight.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_00:but that's something we can't reasonably assume like that.\\nSPEAKER_02:No.\\nSPEAKER_00:and make plans with that because.\\nSPEAKER_02:No but you sort of see people's patterns I mean.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:even if it's not always like.\\nSPEAKER_02:that I mean if it's like that you know eighty per.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Mm-hmm.\\nSPEAKER_02:cent of the time then But you're right we can't make assumptions too.\\nSPEAKER_02:much.\\nSPEAKER_04:So people would like to see uh the office organised by uh by by rank like professors and students and.\\nSPEAKER_00:I don't know Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:I think Well it's up to us how we do it I can see benefits of.\\nSPEAKER_02:both But.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah it certainly is.\\nSPEAKER_00:One point I can say by experience it's really hard to share an office with three people because it makes much more noise that only being two in an office.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah Plus the computers.\\nSPEAKER_00:Plus the computers So.\\nSPEAKER_03:Plus the Mm-hmm.\\nSPEAKER_02:And we all know what it's like to have five computers in your office.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah So we might be It might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room and not to be necessary a room with three people A working.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:room.\\nSPEAKER_03:but if there are people coming in I mean we have these people working for uh two months who comes in the summertime or something I think we should reserve a little bit space for them too So uh.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah that's a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room.\\nSPEAKER_03:It's quite big.\\nSPEAKER_02:then everyone has an office right 'Cause it's maximum eighteen So take away three.\\nSPEAKER_00:Oh yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:spaces and you're.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm Oh yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:fifteen.\\nSPEAKER_02:and you're right if we do have a whoever who.\\nSPEAKER_00:Okay.\\nSPEAKER_02:comes.\\nSPEAKER_03:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:in then we have nowhere Well we can put.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:them in the reading room but that kind of defeats the.\\nSPEAKER_02:purpose Mm-hmm.\\nSPEAKER_00:So the other solution is to say okay we use a three person room but only with two person each time And leave a spare space.\\nSPEAKER_04:Yeah that's a good idea.\\nSPEAKER_03:For.\\nSPEAKER_00:for or.\\nSPEAKER_04:yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:yeah mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:But avoiding having three person full-time in a same room.\\nSPEAKER_00:could be a good idea I.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah that's.\\nSPEAKER_00:think.\\nSPEAKER_02:Or again.\\nSPEAKER_03:yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:find.\\nSPEAKER_03:is.\\nSPEAKER_02:people who don't work the same hours.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:It doesn't completely solve the problem.\\nSPEAKER_02:but Yeah I think.\\nSPEAKER_00:So for the reading room we will have a two person room.\\nSPEAKER_03:Maybe that would.\\nSPEAKER_02:so.\\nSPEAKER_04:Yeah Everybody agrees on that.\\nSPEAKER_03:be good.\\nSPEAKER_02:A.\\nSPEAKER_04:yep How about.\\nSPEAKER_02:person'll be too small anyways.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_04:how about this room.\\nSPEAKER_02:The one on the.\\nSPEAKER_00:Which.\\nSPEAKER_02:bottom.\\nSPEAKER_04:Yeah at the bottom in the middle.\\nSPEAKER_00:With the.\\nSPEAKER_04:With a view to the mountains yeah It has three windows so I think it's uh Two.\\nSPEAKER_02:Two Well which There's three two.\\nSPEAKER_04:one.\\nSPEAKER_02:person rooms That has two windows.\\nSPEAKER_04:The the middle one.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah it's.\\nSPEAKER_02:Which is.\\nSPEAKER_04:Two.\\nSPEAKER_02:fine And still a big.\\nSPEAKER_00:Big.\\nSPEAKER_02:room.\\nSPEAKER_00:black stripe is the windows.\\nSPEAKER_04:Oh the big.\\nSPEAKER_00:not.\\nSPEAKER_00:the thin one between the.\\nSPEAKER_04:Oh Ah okay.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah so I should have explained.\\nSPEAKER_02:that.\\nSPEAKER_00:big But what about the the other one which has only one windows but in the courtyard it maybe more quiet.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah but then you get don't get a lot of light for reading.\\nSPEAKER_00:We have electricity so I hope.\\nSPEAKER_02:Really.\\nSPEAKER_00:No it's a question I mean it it's quite noisy outside with the streets and.\\nSPEAKER_03:On the.\\nSPEAKER_02:That's.\\nSPEAKER_03:sixth floor I don't know.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah we are on the sixth floor.\\nSPEAKER_02:I I like the idea of looking out over.\\nSPEAKER_04:Me too.\\nSPEAKER_02:lots of.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah And.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:stop.\\nSPEAKER_03:are if you are reading.\\nSPEAKER_02:space.\\nSPEAKER_00:So it's a relaxing room.\\nSPEAKER_02:Well I mean that that's the whole point right It's just somewhere to.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:get out.\\nSPEAKER_00:no okay Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:office and go and.\\nSPEAKER_00:yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:Do Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:something else for.\\nSPEAKER_02:while whether you're reading or just kind.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm yeah yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:of staring off into space.\\nSPEAKER_04:Yeah and you can look outside of the window if you have a quick meeting there You.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm So what.\\nSPEAKER_04:know.\\nSPEAKER_00:about.\\nSPEAKER_04:meetings always get.\\nSPEAKER_00:one of the room in the.\\nSPEAKER_00:corner.\\nSPEAKER_04:longer.\\nSPEAKER_00:So you have three windows It's even better.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah we could do that.\\nSPEAKER_03:Why.\\nSPEAKER_00:But you have less wall to put shelves and stuff like.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:that If you intend the reading room being more a library or.\\nSPEAKER_02:We have some shelves like cabinet.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:type shelves for the reading room But it's not really intended to be a library I mean we have.\\nSPEAKER_03:A library.\\nSPEAKER_02:an.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_03:downstairs Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:library Um but the other idea is to take 'Cause right now we all have bookshelves So one idea might be to take sort of the books that aren't frequently used by.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:people put.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah Kind of yeah small.\\nSPEAKER_02:room So it becomes sort of.\\nSPEAKER_02:a.\\nSPEAKER_00:library No no.\\nSPEAKER_02:mini-library but not like a library.\\nSPEAKER_02:system library just go and borrow.\\nSPEAKER_00:no No no sure.\\nSPEAKER_02:your collegues' books.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_00:So are we all agree about these two person rooms Which.\\nSPEAKER_04:I don't.\\nSPEAKER_00:one.\\nSPEAKER_04:know.\\nSPEAKER_00:corner.\\nSPEAKER_02:I think the middle one.\\nSPEAKER_03:In the middle.\\nSPEAKER_00:The middle.\\nSPEAKER_03:yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:Okay Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah It's also sort of central to the layout so.\\nSPEAKER_02:everyone.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm Okay.\\nSPEAKER_02:sort of has more or less the same.\\nSPEAKER_02:distance to It's not that it makes that much of a difference.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm-hmm.\\nSPEAKER_02:but Why not Uh Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:So we can exclude this one to make an.\\nSPEAKER_00:office.\\nSPEAKER_02:Actually what I can do is.\\nSPEAKER_00:Or maybe write on the board I don't know.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah Um actually that's a good idea just put it up.\\nSPEAKER_00:So we have the map and.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah So This really isn't to scale but Oh well Um That's really not to.\\nSPEAKER_00:It's alright.\\nSPEAKER_03:Oh.\\nSPEAKER_02:scale Um so we've got an office there And there's two and one.\\nSPEAKER_00:Three yeah Yeah yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:Is.\\nSPEAKER_00:So.\\nSPEAKER_02:Okay so this is that And this becomes the reading room right.\\nSPEAKER_00:Okay Is that a mountain Okay.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yes.\\nSPEAKER_00:And that an old town.\\nSPEAKER_03:And.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah should we.\\nSPEAKER_03:We.\\nSPEAKER_00:decide also the.\\nSPEAKER_03:a.\\nSPEAKER_00:administration stuff And.\\nSPEAKER_03:room.\\nSPEAKER_02:Sure Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:So we exclude the the thing we are quite sure.\\nSPEAKER_00:and then we discuss the.\\nSPEAKER_04:I was.\\nSPEAKER_02:Okay.\\nSPEAKER_04:thinking of maybe we should assign Gisella into this three person office Because we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes Then we could have Gisella and the two fifty per cent people sharing the three.\\nSPEAKER_03:Person room.\\nSPEAKER_04:person room Well.\\nSPEAKER_00:That's really noisy to be in the same office.\\nSPEAKER_00:with the administration.\\nSPEAKER_02:But if Gisella.\\nSPEAKER_04:They're.\\nSPEAKER_02:works fifty.\\nSPEAKER_04:per.\\nSPEAKER_02:percent and they work fifty.\\nSPEAKER_04:yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah that.\\nSPEAKER_02:percent That's.\\nSPEAKER_00:just imply you expect people to come when Gisella is not.\\nSPEAKER_00:working.\\nSPEAKER_02:true Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:and that's not really fair if you.\\nSPEAKER_04:Well I mean.\\nSPEAKER_00:So we.\\nSPEAKER_04:it yeah we could.\\nSPEAKER_00:put Gisella in the two people room which is near the mailbox No.\\nSPEAKER_00:I don't know it's just.\\nSPEAKER_04:We could I mean I don't know how noisy she.\\nSPEAKER_04:is.\\nSPEAKER_02:But.\\nSPEAKER_00:question you always have the.\\nSPEAKER_04:It's.\\nSPEAKER_00:phone ringing even if the.\\nSPEAKER_02:Just.\\nSPEAKER_03:Or.\\nSPEAKER_00:even when she's not.\\nSPEAKER_02:Does.\\nSPEAKER_00:working Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:own printer.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yes yes she does.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah but that's that's a good point from Nikos to say that she needs to be near the mail box and the printer and.\\nSPEAKER_02:Well if you put her.\\nSPEAKER_00:and the and.\\nSPEAKER_02:in.\\nSPEAKER_00:stuff like that.\\nSPEAKER_02:this room.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:close.\\nSPEAKER_00:except the door is not really.\\nSPEAKER_04:Convenient for her yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:convenient.\\nSPEAKER_02:True Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:No but I think if if the main um how can I put that the mm If the main reason to put to to choose Gisella's place is the proximity of the mailbox it should be a two people room and not a three people room.\\nSPEAKER_04:Okay It's fine with me.\\nSPEAKER_00:Otherwise we have a one people room and.\\nSPEAKER_02:I don't know how much the proximity to the mailbox matters because usually when she's here and she picks up the mail she.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:actually brings it to your.\\nSPEAKER_04:Yeah it's it's not the.\\nSPEAKER_02:office.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah No but it's.\\nSPEAKER_02:I_T_.\\nSPEAKER_00:it's.\\nSPEAKER_02:uses our mailboxes.\\nSPEAKER_00:also it's also the place of the.\\nSPEAKER_03:And the.\\nSPEAKER_04:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:place where we all pass kind of.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:That's true.\\nSPEAKER_03:It should be some.\\nSPEAKER_00:Because if.\\nSPEAKER_03:central place.\\nSPEAKER_00:near the mail box and it seems to be the only place where there is room for.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:that Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah unless you put it into an office.\\nSPEAKER_02:which is just annoying I think.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah oh.\\nSPEAKER_02:'Cause.\\nSPEAKER_00:no Yeah no.\\nSPEAKER_02:you put it into Gisella's office.\\nSPEAKER_02:it's gonna.\\nSPEAKER_00:it's.\\nSPEAKER_02:be Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:And it's too big and.\\nSPEAKER_04:Okay we should write this down Do we agree that.\\nSPEAKER_02:So.\\nSPEAKER_04:the that the photocopier and the networked printer goes next to the mailboxes.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah that's a good.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:idea.\\nSPEAKER_02:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_00:And then we can for the moment put Gisella in this corner room if you agree I don't know.\\nSPEAKER_04:Yeah What with.\\nSPEAKER_02:At the.\\nSPEAKER_02:beginning we said that we were gonna give her one of the one person rooms.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah But this option of putting.\\nSPEAKER_02:Okay Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:Gisella near the I mean she is.\\nSPEAKER_04:I mean she is sharing an office right now and I Has anybody heard of any complaints that she's too loud or.\\nSPEAKER_02:Well she's Go ahead.\\nSPEAKER_00:not.\\nSPEAKER_00:sharing an office I mean we put some.\\nSPEAKER_02:in there And.\\nSPEAKER_00:trainee in Gisella's office because there is a spare.\\nSPEAKER_00:room and.\\nSPEAKER_02:they are.\\nSPEAKER_00:that's quite.\\nSPEAKER_02:really in a.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah that's quite uh I mean that's quite important to keep a spare room in Gisella's office if we need more.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:staff but I wouldn't work in Gisella's office.\\nSPEAKER_04:Okay.\\nSPEAKER_02:I think it's just a question of work conditions like if you are a.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:and you only coming in for two months then you can put up.\\nSPEAKER_03:it Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:with it but if you're.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:there you know for.\\nSPEAKER_03:So for.\\nSPEAKER_02:the full year.\\nSPEAKER_03:now if.\\nSPEAKER_00:For example and there.\\nSPEAKER_03:we.\\nSPEAKER_00:is no room in the cupboards for any people except Gisella because she got lots of paper archives.\\nSPEAKER_04:Yeah that's.\\nSPEAKER_00:and.\\nSPEAKER_04:true.\\nSPEAKER_00:stuff like that So it's really she needs.\\nSPEAKER_02:Mm-hmm.\\nSPEAKER_04:She needs spaces Okay.\\nSPEAKER_00:space Mm.\\nSPEAKER_03:Yeah yeah But we can uh reserve So if you reserve a two people room we can put uh trainees.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah in.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:Further on.\\nSPEAKER_02:there.\\nSPEAKER_03:if they are.\\nSPEAKER_02:to.\\nSPEAKER_03:in the same room.\\nSPEAKER_00:Hmm.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_04:Okay so Gisella at this southwest office.\\nSPEAKER_00:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:In the corner South.\\nSPEAKER_00:Are you sure it's southwest I dunno if if this map is a.\\nSPEAKER_02:Well southwest if that's north.\\nSPEAKER_00:Okay the map is north oriented.\\nSPEAKER_02:Southwest for.\\nSPEAKER_00:Okay No.\\nSPEAKER_02:Well I'm assuming that's what you meant right That.\\nSPEAKER_04:Yeah yeah that that one.\\nSPEAKER_00:Okay I.\\nSPEAKER_04:yeah.\\nSPEAKER_02:But that's southeast.\\nSPEAKER_00:don't.\\nSPEAKER_02:anyways.\\nSPEAKER_03:Southeast yeah.\\nSPEAKER_04:Oh right yeah.\\nSPEAKER_03:That's southeast.\\nSPEAKER_04:southeast yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:Anyways yeah but.\\nSPEAKER_02:This office right That's.\\nSPEAKER_04:Yeah this office yeah.\\nSPEAKER_00:Okay You know because with mountain mountains and old town it's not No sorry until but.\\nSPEAKER_02:No I I'm very bad at orienting where's north in Geneva I always get it wrong But I just assumed Nikos.\\nSPEAKER_04:Uh yeah I.\\nSPEAKER_02:was.\\nSPEAKER_04:was.\\nSPEAKER_02:the.\\nSPEAKER_00:Okay.\\nSPEAKER_04:just talking about uh.\\nSPEAKER_02:orientation here.\\nSPEAKER_00:No because.\\nSPEAKER_04:here on.\\nSPEAKER_00:sunrise and sunshine is quite uh sunshine sunrise and sunset is quite.\\nSPEAKER_02:Oh that's true.\\nSPEAKER_00:also.\\nSPEAKER_02:So wait.\\nSPEAKER_00:something.\\nSPEAKER_02:we.\\nSPEAKER_00:into account.\\nSPEAKER_02:face the old town we face the old town.\\nSPEAKER_02:now and we are facing.\\nSPEAKER_00:Uh

Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:Yeah It The building design is pretty much the same as the one we have now.\\nSPEAKER_02:we're.\\nSPEAKER_00:Okay.\\nSPEAKER_02:just getting more space this way because.\\nSPEAKER_03:Okay Mm-hmm.\\nSPEAKER_02:we.\\nSPEAKER_02:couldn't move in the other.\\nSPEAKER_00:Mm.\\nSPEAKER_02:building 'cause it was occupied by the other departments.\\nSPEAKER_03:Okay

Um I think it's the security is sort of the same as it is in the current building. So as long as the things are physically attached to the wall so. Mm. they can't be removed. We can put it. then it. Okay Mm. should be okay to leave them in the hall It's just a question of whether you are. printing sensitive documents or. Mm. Mm yeah. whatever. So we only get one printer for fifteen people. Um well we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers I think Susan has a personal. Yeah Yeah. printer Gisella has one maybe. I can't. and. remember. it Mm. who else Yeah But no-one else gets. their own printer In terms of equipment it's sort of the same thing as we have. Mm-hmm Mm. now Um So what I'd propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into. specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back. Yeah Mm yeah. later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to. Okay. exactly where to put people Does that work Oh and on the map the little half-circular well quater circles are. Mm-hmm. doors which I'm. 'Kay. okay. assuming you've figured out but just. Yeah. in case And there's just the one room that actually has two doors going into it. The three person. the. room. person room on the right Yeah. rooms. yeah And do we need a room like a reading room or Yeah. Yes yeah A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room. That's a good idea. Mm Okay. So we should leave a space for that And we. can because like I said maximum eighteen people in those rooms and there is only fifteen of. Yeah Mm Yeah. us And I don't know if you've noticed but two of us are only here half the time So. Martin and David um are half the time at the E_P_F_L_ and half the time in Geneva So sort of keep that in. Mm. mind I guess when you are doing the actual planning. Mm. The first split we can do is between administration and reasearch uh I. Yeah. mean it's completely different work so we can deal with administration and decide something for administration and then for the other. Mm-hmm Yeah But Gisella's really the only. Yeah But at least deal with. administrator. administrator Yeah Yeah. that particular situation. and then see with the other because I was thinking uh Gisella is quite I mean Gisella's work is quite noisy because it's secretary so yeah. Yeah And she's always moving. lot of phone call and stuff like that. so Yeah. around No. so you won't share an office with Gisella. unless you are fifty per cent and not the fifty per cent Gisella is. Yeah. working which is another condition. Which I don't know if we can assume that there isn't going to be any overlap. Yeah mm. between. So I don't know maybe we can decide that Gisella is having one of the one person room. Yeah I I would suggest that. Yeah that would. too Yeah. maybe convenient. Yeah Either. Mm. that or maybe put her in a two person room. With someone Yeah. with the equipment or. and with. Yeah. the the. someone. who is who is fifty. photocopier or Maybe not. percent. the photocopier but the printer. Yeah But at least the thing we know that Gisella is gonna be alone. Yeah yeah. Yeah okay. Or. mm-hmm. equipment but humanly. And not with a hundred. percent staff. alone. yeah a staff worker. Okay so that's a one person room but we don't know how how big they are Or it's hard to tell I mean Gisella has this funny uh typing uh. Typing. Yeah I mean the. thing Yeah. machine. aren't tiny if you look at the. Computer fax. this. Yeah Yeah. So probably she should get the fax right. Yeah yeah that. Yes. makes sense to put the fax in there Uh So. And then I think the main discussion we should have is um if we want to make group of among the same project or among the same title. Yeah. Or uh yeah professor assistent or uh. or. Yeah Or Yeah Couple of professor and assistant or. Or uh yeah. That's more a conceptual than a practical question. Yeah. Well the third option is just completely mix everyone up. Yeah. which some. Yeah. people say is better sort of for a group environment so that you are not stuck only with the people who are working on your. Yeah. Yeah that's. project Right. true. share an office with someone. Mm Yeah. who's on a completely different project you find out. about that. Mm Mm. project but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular. Mm. yeah. basis. mm But still I find it's quite easy if you are with people who work in the same project in the same room because you have the meetings or people come and ask you discuss things maybe I don't know if it's uh for other people who is not working on the same. Yeah Yeah but. project Yeah. will have this reading. true. room which can be. true. 'Kay uh will. Yeah. Yeah. it be dedicated for reading and for studying or can we have meetings there Can reserve it for meetings. I think it's not a question of reserving it because there's other rooms at the university that you can reserve for a. Yeah for a. meeting. real meeting. if it's. empty then sure you can use it. You can. for a. meeting There's nothing wrong with. Mm. that But. mm-hmm. think if someone's already reading in there it's not. Yeah Mm. fair to go and kick them out just because you want to have a. meeting 'cause. Well the the problem is if you have to go across the building and it adds some overhead every time you want to have some short. Meeting about. meeting. the. No. discuss. project. some issues Or maybe we shouldn't call. But if you're having a. it. short meeting you don't. but. really make an appointment for it You just kind. Yeah. of go to someone's office and go down. Mm-hmm. for a coffee or. Mm yeah. whatever 'Cause there's still the cafeterias that you can use for informal. Mm yeah The other thing we should take into account is if you receive student or not because. Yeah. Marianne and I interact a lot with. Yeah Hmm. student and we. have reception hours and stuff like that. Mm-hmm Yeah. So it means you get time where a lot of people come along and talk and So. it's maybe. And the other. Yeah so maybe. too. it's not really. there's. nice. you Well but. to have to share an office with somebody like us having a lot of social life. and. then you either share. People. offices with each. going. Yeah Mm. other which doesn't really solve the problem because chances are you are not gonna have office hours at the exact same time. Yeah we don't. So you're. Yeah Mm. still going to have Like unless you get individual. offices I don't know if there's an easy way. Yeah I dunno. to. find a solution for that 'Cause even if each of you share with a professor then it's the same thing for. Yeah mm. the professor. Yep yeah. mm. But it is something to keep in mind Unless you end up sharing an office with someone where your schedules completely don't overlap and then you can schedule office. Yeah Mm. hours when the other person isn't there Some. people come in around eleven and some people come in around eight. Yeah. Mm. but that's something we can't reasonably assume like that. No. and make plans with that because. No but you sort of see people's patterns I mean. Yeah Mm. even if it's not always like. that I mean if it's like that you know eighty per. Yeah Mm-hmm. cent of the time then But you're right we can't make assumptions too. much. So people would like to see uh the office organised by uh by by rank like professors and students and. I don't know Yeah. I think Well it's up to us how we do it I can see benefits of. both But. Yeah it certainly is. One point I can say by experience it's really hard to share an office with three people because it makes much more noise that only being two in an office. Yeah Plus the computers. Plus the computers So. Plus the Mm-hmm. And we all know what it's like to have five computers in your office. Yeah So we might be It might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room and not to be necessary a room with three people A working. Yeah. room. but if there are people coming in I mean we have these people working for uh two months who comes in the summertime or something I think we should reserve a little bit space for them too So uh. Yeah that's a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room. It's quite big. then everyone has an office right 'Cause it's maximum eighteen So take away three. Oh yeah. spaces and you're. Mm Oh yeah. fifteen. and you're right if we do have a whoever who. Okay. comes. Mm. in then we have nowhere Well we can put. Yeah Yeah. them in the reading room but that kind of defeats the. purpose Mm-hmm. So the other solution is to say okay we use a three person room but only with two person each time And leave a spare space. Yeah that's a good idea. For. for or. yeah. yeah mm. Yeah Yeah. But avoiding having three person full-time in a same room. could be a good idea I. Yeah that's. think. Or again. yeah. find. is. people who don't work the same hours. Yeah Mm. It doesn't completely solve the problem. but Yeah I think. So for the reading room we will have a two person room. Maybe that would. so. Yeah Everybody agrees on that. be good. A. yep How about. person'll be too small anyways. Yeah. how about this room. The one on the. Which. bottom. Yeah at the bottom in the middle. With the. With a view to the mountains yeah It has three windows so I think it's uh Two. Two Well which There's three two. one. person rooms That has two windows. The the middle one. Yeah it's. Which is. Two. fine And still a big. Big. room. black stripe is the windows. Oh the big. not. the thin one between the. Oh Ah okay. Yeah so I should have explained. that. big But what about the the other one which has only one windows but in the courtyard it maybe more quiet. Yeah but then you get don't get a lot of light for reading. We have electricity so I hope. Really. No it's a question I mean it it's quite noisy outside with the streets and. On the. That's. sixth floor I don't know. Yeah we are on the sixth floor. I I like the idea of looking out over. Me too. lots of. Yeah And. Yeah. stop. are if you are reading. space. So it's a relaxing room. Well I mean that that's the whole point right It's just somewhere to. Yeah yeah. get out. no okay Yeah. office and go and. yeah. Do Yeah. something else for. while whether you're reading or just kind. Mm yeah yeah. of staring off into space. Yeah and you can look outside of the window if you have a quick meeting there You. Mm So what. know. about. meetings always get. one of the room in the. corner. longer. So you have three windows It's even better. Yeah we could do that. Why. But you have less wall to put shelves and stuff like. Yeah. that If you intend the reading room being more a library or. We have some shelves like cabinet. Mm Yeah. type shelves for the reading room But it's not really intended to be a library I mean we have. A library. an. Mm. downstairs Mm. library Um but the other idea is to take 'Cause right now we all have bookshelves So one idea might be to take sort of the books that aren't frequently used by. Yeah Mm. people put. Yeah Kind of yeah small. room So it becomes sort of. a. library No no. mini-library but not like a library. system library just go and borrow. no No no sure. your collegues' books. Mm. So are we all agree about these two person rooms Which. I don't. one. know. corner. I think the middle one. In the middle. The middle. yeah. Okay Yeah. Yeah It's also sort of central to the layout so. everyone. Mm Okay. sort of has more or less the same. distance to It's not that it makes that much of a difference. Mm-hmm. but Why not Uh Yeah. So we can exclude this one to make an. office. Actually what I can do is. Or maybe write on the board I don't know. Yeah Um actually that's a good idea just put it up. So we have the map and. Yeah So This really isn't to scale but Oh well Um That's really not to. It's alright. Oh. scale Um so we've got an office there And there's two and one. Three yeah Yeah yeah. Is. So. Okay so this is that And this becomes the reading room right. Okay Is that a mountain Okay. Yes. And that an old town. And. Yeah should we. We. decide also the. a. administration stuff And. room. Sure Yeah. So we exclude the the thing we are quite sure. and then we discuss the. I was. Okay. thinking of maybe we should assign Gisella into this three person office Because we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes Then we could have Gisella and the two fifty per cent people sharing the three. Person room. person room Well. That's really noisy to be in the same office. with the administration. But if Gisella. They're. works fifty. per. percent and they work fifty. yeah. Yeah that. percent That's. just imply you expect people to come when Gisella is not. working. true Yeah. and that's not really fair if you. Well I mean. So we. it yeah we could. put Gisella in the two people room which is near the mailbox No. I don't know it's just. We could I mean I don't know how noisy she. is. But. question you always have the. It's. phone ringing even if the. Just. Or. even when she's not. Does. working Yeah. own printer. Yes yes she does. Yeah but that's that's a good point from Nikos to say that she needs to be near the mail box and the printer and. Well if you put her. and the and. in. stuff like that. this room. Yeah. close. except the door is not really. Convenient for her yeah. convenient. True Yeah. No but I think if if the main um how can I put that the mm If the main reason to put to to choose Gisella's place is the proximity of the mailbox it should be a two people room and not a three people room. Okay It's fine with me. Otherwise we have a one people room and. I don't know how much the proximity to the mailbox matters because usually when she's here and she picks up the mail she. Yeah. actually brings it to your. Yeah it's it's not the. office. Yeah No but it's. I_T_. it's. uses our mailboxes. also it's also the place of the. And the. Yeah. place where we all pass kind of. Yeah. That's true. It should be some. Because if. central place. near the mail box and it seems to be the only place where there is room for. Yeah. that Yeah. Yeah unless you put it into an office. which is just annoying I think. Yeah oh. 'Cause. no Yeah no. you put it into Gisella's office. it's gonna. it's. be Yeah. And it's too big and. Okay we should write this down Do we agree that. So. the that the photocopier and the networked printer goes next to the mailboxes. Yeah that's a good. Yeah. idea. Mm. And then we can for the moment put Gisella in this corner room if you agree I don't know. Yeah What with. At the. beginning we said that we were gonna give her one of the one person rooms. Yeah But this option of putting. Okay Yeah. Gisella near the I mean she is. I mean she is sharing an office right now and I Has anybody heard of any complaints that she's too loud or. Well she's Go ahead. not. sharing an office I mean we put some. in there And. trainee in Gisella's office because there is a spare. room and. they are. that's quite. really in a. Yeah that's quite uh I mean that's quite important to keep a spare room in Gisella's office if we need more. Yeah. staff but I wouldn't work in Gisella's office. Okay. I think it's just a question of work conditions like if you are a. Yeah yeah. and you only coming in for two months then you can put up. it Yeah. with it but if you're. Mm. there you know for. So for. the full year. now if. For example and there. we. is no room in the cupboards for any people except Gisella because she got lots of paper archives. Yeah that's. and. true. stuff like that So it's really she needs. Mm-hmm. She needs spaces Okay. space Mm. Yeah yeah But we can uh reserve So if you reserve a two people room we can put uh trainees. Yeah in. Yeah. Further on. there. if they are. to. in the same room. Hmm. Yeah. Okay so Gisella at this southwest office. Yeah. Yeah. In the corner South. Are you sure it's southwest I dunno if if this map is a. Well southwest if that's north. Okay the map is north oriented. Southwest for. Okay No. Well I'm assuming that's what you meant right That. Yeah yeah that that one. Okay I. yeah. But that's southeast. don't. anyways. Southeast yeah. Oh right yeah. That's southeast. southeast yeah. Anyways yeah but. This office right That's. Yeah this office yeah. Okay You know because with mountain mountains and old town it's not No sorry until but. No I I'm very bad at orienting where's north in Geneva I always get it wrong But I just assumed Nikos. Uh yeah I. was. was. the. Okay. just talking about uh. orientation here. No because. here on. sunrise and sunshine is quite uh sunshine sunrise and sunset is quite. Oh that's true. also. So wait. something. we. into account. face the old town we face the old town. now and we are facing. Uh northeast. North. northeast Okay So This. Sunrise. is northeast. yeah east No. east We we have sun in the morning only. Yeah. When do we have sun. So it does mean that the three piece room which is in the opposite of the northeast. Mm-hmm This one. is the most sunny one. Let's say that. The three. But. It's it's the. people room. one you have of now you both. It's the oven. More or less You get. Well there is a quite a lot of. sun yes and. the sunset then No And it's really. warm and. no. You get lots. warm. of sun during summer yes. Do you. Yeah yeah. Uh. true. by the way is it a six floor building or is there more. Yeah we're the top floor. Okay So it's warm Mm. Yeah It The building design is pretty much the same as the one we have now. we're. Okay. just getting more space this way because. Okay Mm-hmm. we. couldn't move in the other. Mm. building 'cause it was occupied by the other departments. Okay good so And. So. next. many rooms and uh how many place do we have. So we have reserved now. Actually why don't. two. I change it on. person. here as well So that's Gisella. Yeah plus one spare. Plus spare. place but really the last place to be used. Plus fax. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And then this is the reading room. Okay We. Oops Um So that leaves us with what. Six eight. got two three four. We got. fourteen places which is. nine. For fourteen people. places For fourteen. For. For fifteen people. people. Yeah No for fourteen 'cause Gisella's. Yeah. Yeah. already got a room. Yeah Yeah yeah. So we are good. Okay Bless you So. Excuse me Okay Um. So I'm gonna take Gisella off of that list as well I'll put her in grey I guess. Can we group people by their name. Marianne. I to Marianne So. Alphabetically. Marianne Yeah. it's. why not. be. Yeah that would be fun. Is is. Is there anybody who's not happy with the current situation so we could try to just keep the same arrangement just on the new building. Yeah that's going. That's. that can be That's boring but. That's. boring. can be a good. boring. idea but do do we can we do. Can we No. that Because there is. No we. we. don't. because No we can't. We. there is. we. two And two three. extra one person office and. Two three. person. person offices yeah Plus we have the two people who aren't there now that we have to. Yeah So. put. somewhere We can keep some of the people together that are together. Mm Yeah yeah. now but not everyone definitely. Okay So let's start then top to bottom Maggie. Well why don't. Susan. we take a break and go off and think about it. Yeah I think we. And. clear things a. once we have. little bit up too Yeah. concrete. Okay. ideas we can come back and finish it 'cause if we just sit here and. Yeah Yeah. discuss it's gonna take a long time and we're gonna. start. yeah Okay So let's. arguing and get cranky and. Alright so. have a. Yeah Yep. You have X_P_. That's nice. Mm-hmm Okay.\""

              "\" Okay, so as you guys know, ISCO is too small. Well, the building is too small for our group. So we're moving to a new building. It's going to be the building across the street and we're actually moving in three weeks. But the problem is that the administration wants to know who's going to be in what office in the new building and where we're going to put things like the printer, the fax machine, all the big equipment. And the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people and equipment.  and they want to know where we're going to do all of this by November 2nd. So that means basically next Tuesday. And since we don't really have any other time, we have to make these decisions today. What we're getting is nine rooms for a maximum of 18 people, which is okay, because there's only 15 of us. And all the rooms have windows, luckily, so there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't. There's two views either of the old town or the mountains. And the rooms are various sizes. There's two three people rooms, five two person rooms, which are on the corners of the building. So you actually get windows on two walls.  today.  and two one-person rooms. That's pretty much what the building looks like and then you have the number of people per room. The courtyard, because we're on the sixth floor, you can't actually go out to it, but just means that the windows look out onto open space. You can see the bathrooms, the elevators are sort of further down the hall. The purple bar at the bottom, sort of on the right, is the mailboxes.  All of the windows open, you can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building.  And the equipment that we have to put somewhere are, like I said, the photocopier, which is really big, the fax machine, which is not so big, and the printer, which is relatively big. Each office has a white board, a bulletin board, and a coat rack. No cupboards, like we have in the current offices. And each person gets their own chair, their own corner desk, so like the ones that we have now. A small filing cabinet with three drawers, and by small I mean they're about that tall. And one sort of hanging shelf. So we don't get the bookcases like we have now, but just one shelf that's attached to the wall.  And the people that we have to place, you can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on. And I guess the question, the first question is how we want to organize people, whether we want to do it by rank or by project or...  I don't know, put all the PhD students together, all the professors together, and that sort of thing.  So the idea is that we come up with a plan. There's another group who's going to be working on the same plan later this week. And then Andre and I have to do presentations for the University administrators on the second. So I have to come up with a plan, possibly if we have time of presentation, a quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best.  Okay. A rouge.  So anyone have any ideas or...  I guess.  Do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the whole in terms of security stuff? I mean, my idea is to put the photocopy on the facts in the whole.  Yeah, I think the security is sort of the same as it is in the current building. So, as long as the things are physically attached to the wall so they can't be removed, then it should be okay to leave them in the hall.  So.  Okay.  It's just a question of whether you're printing the sensitive documents or whatever.  Whatever.  So we only get one printer for 15 people.  Well, we get one sort of networked printer. And then I think some of us have personal printers. Nothing Susan has a personal printer. Just Ella has one maybe. Yeah. I can't remember who else. Yeah, but no one else gets their own printer. In terms of equipment, it's sort of the same thing as we have now.  personal.  Yeah.  I can't remember.  So what I'd propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting them to specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to exactly where to put people.  Come back.  proposals us to exactly.  does that?  work. Oh, and on the map the little half circular, quarter circles or doors. Which I'm assuming you figured out, but just in case. And there's just the one room that actually has two doors going into it. The three person room. The three person room on the right.  Okay.  What?  The three person room on the right. Yeah. And do we need a room like a reading room? Yes.  Yes, yeah, a lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room. That's a good idea. So we should leave a space for that. And we can't because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and there's only 15 of us. And I don't know if you noticed, but two of us are only here half the time. So Martin, David, I have the time at the EPF on half the time in Geneva. So  Like this?  Some march  sort of keep that in mind, I guess, when you're doing the actual planning.  The first split we can do is between administration and researcher. Yeah. It's completely different work. So we can deal with administration and decide something for administration and then for the other.  Yeah.  And yeah.  Yeah, but just I was really the only Yeah, but at least deal with that. Yeah  Yeah, but at least deal with that particular situation. And then see with the other. Because I was thinking, Gisela is quite... I mean, Gisela's work is quite noisy because it's secretory. So you get lots of fun call and stuff like that. And she's always moving around. So you want Shia and her face with Gisela. Unless you have 50% and not the 50% Gisela is working. Yeah. Which is another condition.  Yeah.  A lot of fun, cool and stuff like that.  And she's always moving around.  Yeah.  which I don't know if we can assume that there isn't going to be any overlap between them.  Yeah.  So I don't know, maybe we can decide that Giza likes having one of the one person room. Yeah, I would suggest that.  That's what I say. That's what I say.  Yeah.  Maybe it can mean it.  Yeah, either that are maybe put her in a two-person room with the equipment or like we said the photocopier or maybe not the photocopier but the printer.  with a man.  the photocop.  Yeah, but at least the thing we know that Gisela is going to be alone.  Yeah. Okay.  Always equipment but...  Not with a 100% staff and staff worker.  not with a hundred percent staff.  Okay, so it's a one person room but we don't know how big they are. It's hard to tell. I mean, Gisela has this funny typing.  Yeah. I mean the rooms aren't tiny if you look at this. Yeah.  I'm the rooms.  any of you look at this? The fax. Yeah. So probably she should get the fax, right?  Yeah, yeah, that makes sense to put the facts in there.  Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.  So...  And then I think the main discussion we should have is...  if we want to make a group of amongst the same project or amongst the same title.  Yeah, the professor asked us.  professors and anctれる. Oh yeah. Several of Professor Assistants and seniors.  or  or yeah.  That's more conceptual question than a practical question.  Yeah.  Well, the third option is just completely mix everyone up, which some people say is better sort of for group environment so that you're not stuck only with the people who are working on your project. Yeah. Right. So if you share an office with someone who's on a completely different project, you find out about that project, but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular basis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which way? This  Yeah.  And, everyone...  regular basis.  But still I find it's quite easy if you are with people who work in the same project, in the same way, because you have the meetings or people come and ask you discuss things. Maybe, I don't know, if it's...  for other people who are not working the same project. Yeah, but we will have this reading room. Yeah, that's true. Which can be...  Yeah, but we will have this reading room  It's too much, it's okay. Will it be dedicated for reading and for studying? Or can we have meetings that can reserve it for meetings?  Hey.  but it'll be a long time.  I think it's not a question of reserving it because there's other rooms at the university that you can reserve for a meeting. But if it's empty, then sure you can use it for a meeting. There's nothing wrong with that.  because there's  But if it's...  You wi JS  I think if someone's already reading in there, it's not fair to go and kick them out, just because you want to have a meeting. Because...  Yeah.  Well, the problem is you have to go across the building and it adds some overhead every time you want to have some short meeting and discuss some issues. Maybe we shouldn't call it. But if you're having a short meeting...  meeting and discussing.  But if you're having a short meeting, you don't really...  make an appointment for it. You just kind of go to someone's office and go down for a coffee or whatever.  Yeah.  fear whatever.  because there's still the cafeterias that you can use for informal.  Yeah. The other thing we should take into account is if you receive student or not, because...  Yeah.  Marian and I interact a lot with students and we have reception hours and stuff like that. So it means you get time where a lot of people come along and talk and so it's beautiful. And the other Marian does too. Yeah, so maybe it's that three of you. So there's three of you. To share on a face with somebody like us. I think a lot of social life.  and subscribers if you love us children.  hello  Yeah. And the other Marianne does too. Yeah. So maybe it's just a review.  with that process...  Well, but then you either share offices with each other. Yeah. Which doesn't really solve the problem because chances are you're not going to have office hours at the exact same time. Mm. So you're still going to have...  Yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Like unless you get individual offices, I don't know if there's an easy way to find a solution for that.  Hmm.  way too. I didn't know.  because even if each of you share with the professor, then it's the same thing for the professor.  It's the same thing for the professor.  but it is something to keep in mind.  Unless you end up sharing an office with someone where your schedule is completely don't overlap and then you schedule office hours when the other person isn't there. Some people come in around 11 and some people come in around 8.  We'll just schedule office hours.  Yeah, but that's something we can't reasonably assume like that. No. Make plans with that because...  No.  But you sort of see people's patterns. I mean...  Yeah.  even if it's not always like that, I mean, if it's like that, 80% of the time, then.  more  just  But you're right, we can't make assumptions too much.  So people would like to see the office organized by rank like professors and students and I don't know.  I think.  Well, it's up to us how we do it. I can see benefits of both. Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyways...  click on the cursor.  One point I can say by experience, it's really hard to share an office with three people because it makes much more noise that only being two in an office.  Yeah, plus the computers. Let's get into the computers.  Let's take on some videos.  And we all know what it's like to have five computers in your office.  Yeah. So it might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room and not to be necessary a room with three people. A working room.  Yeah, but if there are people coming in, I mean, we have these people working for two months who come in the summertime or something. I think we should reserve a little bit space for them to...  And that's a good point because if we take the three-person room out as a reading room.  It's quite... Then everyone has an offer, right? Because it's maximum 18.  So take away three spaces and you're down to your 15. And you're right, if we do have a stagia or whoever comes in, then we have nowhere. Well, we can put them in the reading room, but that kind of defeats the purpose.  and you're down to your 15.  Okay.  Play...  Yeah.  So the other solution is to say, okay, we use a three person room, but only with two person each time, and leave a spare space. For the training center.  Even if the  Channel is  you know where it is the map.  Yeah.  but avoiding  having three persons full time in the same room could be a good idea. I think.  Yeah.  or again find deep.  Or again, find people who don't work the same hours. Yeah.  Yeah.  It doesn't completely solve the problem.  So for the reading room we will have a 2% room. Yeah, thanks a lot to you. Everybody agrees on that, yeah.  Yeah, I think so. Everybody agrees on that? One person will be too small anyways.  How?  How about this room? The one on the bottom? Yeah, the bottom in the middle. Yeah, with the mountains. It has three windows, so I think it's two.  Yeah some rhythm in there.  the bottom.  In between? Yeah Royalatives. Yes, Yes. Exactly. laboratories? Yes. It spoke in the southern foreign language. Is that one? Yup. Yeah. Isn't it, Israel? Yeah. Is that two words, Sandy? How many can I describe the world then? Yeah. What do I recall one? I remember a once away from the truth  too.  ring theμέte.  Well, which there's three two person rooms.  There's three.  the middle one.  that has two windows.  Yeah.  Which is fine. I install a big room.  Big black stripe is the windows, only the one between the big. Yeah, sorry, I should have explained that. But the other one which has only one windows but in the courtyard it may be more quiet.  Oh, that's...  12  Iintred every other story.  Yeah, it's where I should have explained that.  Yeah, but then you can don't get a lot of light.  for reading.  We have electricity, so I hope. Really?  Really?  Nates are quite noisy outside with the streets and...  On the sixth floor, I don't know.  Yeah, we're on the sixth row.  I know, I like the idea of looking out over...  Yeah, me too. It's the reading. So it's a relaxing room.  But it is really good.  Well, I mean, that's the whole point, right? It's just somewhere to get out of your office and go and do something else for a while, whether you're reading or just kind of staring off into space.  right? It's just somewhere to get out of your office and go in.  Okay煩 Tetra... see ya on Monday be calmerina Ok thank you GRANDT lifting GI bonds CANDER GO INTRO don't know thisreiben  are just kind of yeah.  Yeah, you can look outside of the window if you have a quick meeting. Yeah. So what about one of the room in the corner?  So what about one of the room in the corner? So you have three windows. It's even better.  Yeah, we could do that. Why not?  but you have less wool to put shelves and...  Can do back there.  Yeah.  if you intend to read the room being more a library or  We have some shelves, like cabinet type shelves, for the reading room, but it's not really intended to be a library. I mean, we have.  shape.  Yeah.  and Etsy library.  and anti-library.  the other ideas to take because right now we all have bookshelves. So one idea might be to take sort of the books that aren't frequently used by people, but them all into that room. So it becomes sort of...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of, yeah, it's full of life. Mini library.  Mini library, but not like a library system library. Just go and borrow your colleagues book.  but not like a library system library. Just go and borrow your colleagues' books.  So, are we all agree about these two person rooms?  Which one? I don't know or not, I don't know.  Don't know.  I think the middle one. The middle one. Yeah. It's also sort of central to the layout so everyone sort of has more or less the same distance to.  the middle one.  the layout so everyone's heard. itchens.  It's not that it makes that much of a difference, but...  Why not?  So  so we can exclude this one to make another face.  Yeah.  actually what I can do is...  Or maybe right on the board, I didn't know.  Yeah, I don't know. Actually, it's a good idea. Just put it up.  So we have the map and...  So  This really isn't too scale, but oh well.  Um.  That's really not to scale.  All right. Good enough.  to light.  So we've got...  and off is there.  There's...  See you next to Antoin.  3, yeah. That. Yeah, yeah.  can  Yeah yeah, oh.  too.  I guess this is...  and this becomes the reading room, right?  Okay.  Is that a mountain? Yes. Okay.  Like awesome.  and that's not bad.  Let's do an launcher.  Yes, we decide also the administration stuff. And...  Yes, we decide also the administration stuff.  Sure.  So we exclude the thing we are quite sure and then we discuss that. I will see.  Yeah.  I was thinking of maybe we should assign Gisella into this 3 person office because we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes and we could have Gisella and the 250% people sharing the 3.  A friend sitting there, was wouldn't know, what did they do... in Gu dzviqa... How did it happen? Pooh Bus, 10 мечECON kan Silence  a different personality only one person made these relationships,  That's really no easy to be in the same office. Well, the administration, but if just I work 50% of it  But if Gisela works 50% and they work 50%.  Yeah, that just imply you expect people to come when Gisela is not working. That's true. And that's not really fair if you... Yeah. Well, I mean... So we can put Gisela in the two people room.  That's true.  Yeah.  I mean, so we-  which is near the mailbox.  No, we're there, we could.  One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, five, four, one, two, one.  Whew.  I mean I don't know how noisy she is It's just a question you always have the fun ringing  Ehhh- it does not work?  Even if they have even when she's not working.  even if they have even when she's not working. Does she not have her own printer? Yes, yes, it does.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's a good point from Nikos to say that she needs to be near the mailbox and the printer and Well, if you put her in the photography and stuff like that  Well, if you put her in this room here, it's relatively close.  relatively close. Except the door is not really convenient for her.  true.  but I think if the main, how can I put that?  If the main reason to choose this last place is the proximity of the mailbox, it should be a two people room and not a three people room.  Okay. It's fine with me. Otherwise, we have the one people room in.  Okay.  I don't know how much the proximity to the mailbox matters, because usually when she's here and she picks up the mail, she actually brings it to your office. It's more the administrative administration that uses our mailboxes.  Yeah.  It's more the ad-e-ministration that uses RML boxes. This is the place of the photography. Yeah.  And the place where we all pass kind of...  Yeah.  Let's try it.  It says it keeps it going to be a fucking fuckin ...  Because if we put the photocopy near the mailbox and it seems to be the only place where there is room Yeah  Yeah.  And unless you put it into an office which is just annoying I think. Yeah. Even if you put it into just that little office it's gonna be...  So I thought we'll begin with this one.  Annoying I think yeah even if you  that was off of us, it's gonna be. It needs to be again.  Yeah.  Okay, maybe we should try this done. Do we agree that the photo copier and the network printer goes next to the mailbox? Yeah, yeah, that's good. Okay.  Yeah.  Red, Red.  And then we can, for the moment, put this line in this corner room, if you agree. I don't know.  Yeah.  okay, but...  At the beginning we said that we were going to give her one of the one person rooms.  Yeah.  But there was this option of putting the line near the photoreb.  Okay.  Yeah.  I mean, she's sharing enough is right now and has anybody heard of any complaints that she's loud or...  I mean, she's not sharing an office. I mean, we put some... Sag ears in there. In Gisela's office because there is a spare room. And they're not really in a position to comply. Yeah, that's quite... I mean, that's quite important to keep a spare room in Gisela's office if we need more staff. But... 不好意思  Especially airs in there.  And they're not really in a position to complain. Yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't work in this rather face.  Okay.  o  let's hit right on OpenÉ  I think it's just a question of work conditions. Like if you're a stagiar and you're only coming in for two months, then you can put up with it. But if you're there, you know, for some of the full year.  You're gonna lose that sugar. Okay. It's cutiness. Oh, it really ist. Okay. Gonna actually use 70 percent salt during that too. Where are the potatoes? How are their eyes? Your fingers can't even hit you with purple.  Bye.  here there.  Thank you so much.  So like there is no room in the cupboard for any people except Jizella because she got lots of paper, archives and knives and stuff like that. So it's really she needs, she needs space, space.  For example n  okay that saves us as in sub prata  So  But we can reserve, so if you reserve two people room, we can put trainees.  Yeah.  Yeah, and they're wrong, but they need to go in the same room. Yeah.  We're all nothing to go.  in this.  Okay, so Jizella at the southwest of this? Yeah.  Yeah, the corner.  I wish it was Southwest. I'd love this map.  Well, Southwest, if that's North.  Okay, the map is... Southwestern... No, that's... Okay, no...  Southwestern. No, that's not guaranteed. No, no. Well, I'm assuming that's what you meant, right? Yeah, that's the one, yeah. I didn't know. But that's how feast anyways. South-easy. Alright, yeah, that's how feast.  Yeah, that one, yeah. I did know.  Alright, yeah, let's have a seat. Anyways, yeah, but this-  This office, right?  Yeah, this office. You know, because with mountain mountains and old turn, it's not no sorry until but...  Yeah.  No, I'm very bad at orienting where it's north in Geneva. I always get it wrong, but I just assumed Nico's was talking about the orientation here.  Talk to me as a orientation here. Because Sunrise and Sunshine. Sunshine Sunrise and Sunset is quite dope. Oh that's true. A good damn.  Oh that's true.  So wait. Something to be done. We face the old town now. We face the old town now. And we're facing.  Something to do. We face the all time.  It's old time.  and nose east.  Bye.  these 15 minutes.  in a sunrise.  Okay.  So...  This is... It's East. Yeah, it's East.  It's East. No, it's East.  We have sent in the morning only.  Yeah.  When do we have sounds?  So it just means that the three-piece room, which is in the opposite of the North East, is the most anyone.  this one.  Let's say that.  Let's say that. It's the one you have, if not, you both. It's the oven.  Oh, that's.  It's the one you have of now.  the oven.  Well there's some cut in a lot of stuff, right?  You get the sunset and...  Now  And it's really warm and it's really warm.  It's really warm and it's...  Yeah, it's really...  You got lots of sun during summer, yeah?  By the way, is it a 6 floor building or is it more...  Yeah, we're the top floor.  Okay, do it slowly.  The building design is pretty much the same as the one we have now. We're just getting more space this way because we couldn't move in the other building because it was occupied by the other departments.  Okay.  This is why it's big as we...  Okay, good. So...  So how many rooms?  How many?  and how many place do we have?  So we have received all to change it on here as well.  I don't know.  change it on here.  So that's the Zawa.  Yeah, plus one sprayer, a place, but really the last place to be used.  please.  plus fax.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then this is the reading room.  Okay.  Um  So that leaves us with what?  We get two, three, four, four, ten.  14 places, which is...  14 people  For 14 people.  For 14 people. For 14 people. No, for 14 because just that was already. Yeah. Got a room. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we are good.  Okay.  Blessings.  Excuse me.  Thank you.  Yes.  Okay.  Sue.  So I'm going to take Juzella off of.  that list as well. I'll put her in gray, I guess.  Can we group people by their name? I so do Marianne. So it's going to be Marianne's office. It's funny fun.  I also do Marianne. So it's going to be Marianne's place. It's not that fun. Is there anybody who's not happy with the current situation? So we could try to just keep the same arrangement just on the new building.  Yeah, that's going to be boring. That's boring. That can be a good idea. But do we... Can we get that? Because there is... No, we can't. No, we can't. No, we can't. No, we can't. We have one extra...  Let's pour in.  I do ...  That's more like that can be  Yeah.  No, we can't because we have made we can't. We have one extra one person office and  and two, three, two, three, four.  Two three personal offices, yeah. Plus we have the two people who aren't there now.  Yeah.  No, I have to put it somewhere.  No, I have to put some more.  You can keep some of the people together that are together now. Yeah. But...  Hmm.  Yeah yeah  Not everyone, definitely.  Okay.  So let's start then top to bottom, Maggie.  Well, why don't we take a break and go off and think about it? Yeah. And then, once we have more concrete ideas, OK, we can come back and finish it. Because if we just sit here and discuss, it's going to take a long time. We're going to start arguing and get cranky.  Why don't we?  Yeah.  I think we can have more concrete ideas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Start art.  Okay.  So let's have a break. Save your phone.  So let's have a break.  Yeah.  You have XB.  Yep.  That's nice.  부드�akt�  Okay.  So how long is it going?\""

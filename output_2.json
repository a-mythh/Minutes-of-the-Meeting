It's going to be the building across the street and we're actually moving in three weeks. But the problem is that the administration wants to know who's going to be in what office in the new building and where we're going to put things like the printer, the fax machine, all the big equipment. And the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people and equipment."

And all the rooms have windows, luckily, so there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't. There's two views either of the old town or the mountains. And the rooms are various sizes. There's two three people rooms, five two person rooms, which are on the corners of the building. So you actually get windows on two walls."

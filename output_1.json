Yeah, so with the motion, basically the motion tried to estimate what's the motion between two frames, right? If it may image is there, but after it's there, and it looks at how many points are well matched. Okay. So you can see that, like somebody speaking and so on, so before the shot, you can see that usually there are like 90% of the points, at least, right? There's some motion, so... But then, after suddenly, if you go from one frame and you try too much, all the points here, we've like a translation, plus a zoom, plus maybe some rotation, you can't find anything well. So basically, you see that the number of points, maybe only 10% of the points you can match well. So it's easy to detect. And after you can see that indeed, because it's a long shot, and it's almost like a flat plane, you can do a very good registration so the number of points is very high. I mean, the number of points that are matching. And here you basically hear with the histogram. You can see it's very flat, but of course, you should go from this histogram to this, which is essentially green. You have this thickness, a measure, which is here, the kite too.

You can see that it could go to 700. And when it's very nothing, it can be zero. What's Bata-Sharia is between zero and one. So you have not so much amplitude.

I think it's anyway, if it's too summarized, after they may want to go inside to see whether there is no special things I mean. Because after it depends, I mean, if you give only one key frame per shot, after I mean it's 170 images, it's quite fast. Right.
